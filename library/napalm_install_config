module: napalm_install_config
author: David Barroso <dbarroso@spotify.net>
version_added: "1.0.0"
short_description: Replaces the configuration taken from a file on a device running EOS.
description:
    This library will take the configuration from a file and load it into a device running any OS supported by napalm.
    The old configuration will be replaced by the new one.

requirements:
    - napalm

options:
    hostname:
        description: IP or FQDN of the device you want to connect to
        required: true
    username:
        description: Username
        required: true
    dev_os:
        description: OS running the device
        required: true
    password:
        description: Password
        required: true
    config_file:
        description: Where to load the configuration from.
        required: true
    commit_changes:
        description: If set to True the configuration will be actually replaced. If the set to False, we will not
                     apply the changes, just check the differences.
        required: true
    diff_file:
        description: A file where to store the "diff" between the running configuration and the new configuration. If
                     it's not set the diff between configurations is not saved.
        required: False

EXAMPLES = '''
    In our playbook would have something like:

  tasks:
  - name: Assemble configuration
    assemble: src=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/ dest=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/running.conf
  - name: Push Configuration
    napalm_install_config:
        hostname={{ inventory_hostname }}
        username=dbarroso
        dev_os={{os}}
        password=p4ssw0rd
        config_file=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/running.conf
        commit_changes={{commit_changes}}
        diff_file=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/diff

    From the CLI we would trigger the playbook like:

        # We don't commit changes, we only want to check the diff
        $ ansible-playbook -v -e commit_changes=0 napalm_test.yml

        or

        # We actually commit the changes
        $ ansible-playbook -v -e commit_changes=1 napalm_test.yml
