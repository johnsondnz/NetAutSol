# vpnv4 Service definition
#
# Each customer has a uuid assigned which is obtained using `vpn_uuid_start` from `./vars/config_fabric.yml`
# `vpn_uuid_start` fact.  loop.index is added to the `vpn_uuid_start` to generate unique identifiers.
# They aren't truely universially unqiue as loop.index cannot account for removed customers
# uuids therefore get reused.  For the purposes of this lab it works okay.
#
# The uuid is used for vlan_id and sub-interface number generation.
